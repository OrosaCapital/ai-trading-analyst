## nginx snippet to reverse-proxy the relay and support WebSocket upgrades
## Drop this into your nginx `sites-available` / `conf.d` (adjust paths/host as needed)

## Ensure this `map` appears once inside the top-level `http { ... }` block
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
  default upgrade;
  ''      close;
}

  listen 80;

  # Proxy WebSocket upgrades for the relay (path /relay)
  location /relay {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4000;
